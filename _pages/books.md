      It would be a dumb idea to make it worse.</p>
    <p align = "center">Reacher sees a West Point class ring in a pawn shop window. It’s tiny. It&#8217;s a woman cadet’s graduation present to herself. Why would she give it up? Reacher was a West Pointer too, and he knows what she went through to get it.</p>
