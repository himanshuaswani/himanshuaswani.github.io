Hello.
<br/>
My name is Himanshu Aswani. I am a fifth year dual degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) student at the <a href = "https://www.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</a>, pursuing my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering, Master's in Communication and Signal Processing and a Minor in Computer Science and Engineering. 
<br/>
I am currently working on my Master's Thesis project with <a href = "https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/">Prof. Amit Sethi</a>, where we are investigating neural network architectures that allow for efficient transfer learning. My coursework has spanned various areas, primarily Information Theory, Machine Learning and Signal Processing. I spent the summer of 2019 at <a href = "https://www.qualcomm.com/">Qualcomm, Bangalore</a> researching on deep learning models for image quality improvements.
<br/>
I have also had the wonderful opportunity to study abroad at <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore, Singapore</a> for the Fall Semester of 2019.
